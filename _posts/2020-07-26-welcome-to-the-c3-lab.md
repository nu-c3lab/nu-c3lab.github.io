This is an example of a post we can make as part of a lab blog. Posts can quickly be written up markdown, added to the `_posts` directory, and uploaded.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter.
